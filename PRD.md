## Design Direction

The design should feel modern, vibrant, and social - evoking the optimism of after-work gatherings while maintaining clarity and speed.

**Enhanced Implementation**: Modern glassmorphism aesthetic with semi-transparent cards, backdrop blur effects, layered shadows for depth, and stacked 3D elements. Animated gradient backgrounds with parallax drift effects. Extensive use of spring physics animations for natural, delightful interactions. Mouse-tracking 3D tilt effects on cards. Floating decorative elements throughout the interface.
